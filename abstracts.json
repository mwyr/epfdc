More recently, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) have revealed that the flow field at Reynolds numbers close to transition can be very different; the flow in this marginally turbulent regime alternating between two states characterised by four vortices. We present experimental data on the mean flow properties and turbulence statistics in both marginally and fully turbulent flow at relatively low Reynolds numbers using laser Doppler velocimetry. The switching of the flow field between two flow states at marginally turbulent Reynolds numbers is confirmed by bimodal probability density functions of streamwise velocity at certain distances from the wall as well as joint probability density functions of streamwise and wall normal velocities which feature two peaks (see figure 1).",

Both media are considered incompressible. An internal wave, driven by gravity, acts as a free common interface between the media. A depth-dependent current exists such that it is zero at the flatbed, negative at the lid and there is constant vorticity (both zero and non-zero are considered) in the strip adjacent to the internal wave. The current is arbitrary in the layers outside of the strip. \\\\A Hamiltonian formulation is presented in terms of the variables associated with the wave in the strip. The resultant equations of motion show that wave-current interaction is not influenced by the current profile outside of the strip.",

        "content": "Due to the various flow patterns occurring before the onset of turbulent flow, the Taylor-Couette flow system is widely studied to investigate the instability and transition. The present work presents numerical calculations of Taylor-Couette flow where the outer cylinder is a regular straight cylinder, but the inner cylinder has a tilted, conical shape. The fluid motion is investigated numerically using CFD simulations. The apex angle between the inner conical cylinder and the outer right cylinder is varied between 0 and 12. Computations for the onset of Taylor vortices in the classical configuration with straight cylinders show good agreement with experimental data. For the case of a conical inner cylinder, calculations show a decrease in the critical Taylor number for the onset of the first instability with the apex angle. It is found that the gap width varies in height, and the Taylor vortices then vary in size, being large where the gap is wide, and small where the gap is narrow.",

        "content": "Slipstream is defined as the induced airflow caused by the high-speed train (HST) movement, which can cause safety hazards and damage concerns. Therefore, much effort has been invested to numerically predict the slipstream. As the flow over a HST is highly turbulent, a Scale-Resolving Solver (SRS) is essential to accurately capture the dynamic flow features: for example, Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) and Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES). In comparison to the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations, both LES and DES are computationally demanding, especially LES, which is rarely used for real-life industrial flows. This study aims to evaluate the capability of a relative new turbulence model, Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS), to predict HST slipstream, which is less computationally demanding than conventional SRSs. The present research systematically studies the performance of SAS under different time-steps, and the results are compared with DES predictions and experimental data.",

Three-dimensional large eddy simulations (LES) along with the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawking acoustic analogy were carried out to compute the sound pressure field. The Smagorinsky-Lilly stress model has been used for the small scales of turbulence. The aim of this research is to develop a CFD methodology for computing the flow induced sound from an elliptic cylinder with good accuracy. The validity of the proposed method is established by comparing the sound pressure spectrum at the receiver location, tonal sound pressure level (SPL\\textsubscript{T}), overall sound pressure level (OASPL) and tonal frequency (F\\textsubscript{T}) with experimental data (Fig. 1). The computed results found in good agreement with the experimental measurements, which shows that the proposed method can be used to advance the research in the future.",

Since Ludwig Prandtl derived the Boundary Layer Equations in 1904, fluid dynamicists---especially those working in the field of aeronautics---have been applying them to investigate ways to modify the flow near the surface of an aeroplane wing. This includes trying to prevent or advance transition to turbulence, delay separation and reduce drag: all in an attempt to cut costs and avoid aircraft stall.\n\nIn this talk we will present a promising technique in laminar flow control, first studied by Huebsch (2006), Huebsch \\& Rothmayer (2011), Grager et al.

We will see that these roughnesses show great potential for delaying or suppressing the separation of a laminar boundary layer, and will briefly investigate how they affect the flow in a condensed layer.",

Unlike more traditional methods,The LBE is based on a discrete kinetic description of fluid motion in which all nonlinearities are confined to algebraic source terms. This allows LBE to exploit parallel computer architectures. Another advantage of LBM is the ease with which it can incorporate boundary conditions. Boundary conditions for the LBE are usually described in terms of distribution functions. However, this introduces an additional slip error. We present the moment-method which imposes boundary conditions on the moments of the distribution function. This allows for the exact satisfaction of hydrodynamic boundary conditions precisely at gridpoints. The method is used to study the dipole-wall collision problem. We consider both normal and oblique collisions and show that predications fory quantities are in good agreement with benchmark data.",

However, small-scale urban flows are inevitably perturbed by unsteady mesoscale meteorological fluctuations. This work investigates the sensitivity of turbulent statistics and pollutant dispersion to time-periodic perturbations. Using large-eddy simulation of a single street canyon, sinusoidal disturbances in the streamwise velocity are introduced in the vicinity of the inflow. Vertical profiles of the turbulent kinetic energy show relatively weak sensitivity to the perturbation frequency, but RMS averages reveal a complicated structure. The pollutant dispersion, which is analysed using the mean tracer age, exhibits a resonance phenomenon at perturbation periods close to the dominant frequency of the streamwise velocity. Connections with stability theory and the predictability of turbulent boundary layers are discussed. The effect of more realistic time dependence is examined.",

We reveal that the asymmetry is not induced by the transition process, but is an instability of the laminar base state. Furthermore, the transition process is responsible for returning symmetry to the flow, which explains why the fully turbulent case is axisymmetric. The deviation from the axisymmetric laminar state is observed to develop in the form of a supercritical bifurcation with square-root dependence on Reynolds number. The asymmetry is non-hysteretic and reversible, not only having a favoured location, but a preferred route between axisymmetry and asymmetry. We also observed the greater the shear-thinning ability, the stronger the fluid asymmetry will appear",

By employing filtering techniques in space and time, we compare turbulent velocity fields containing length scales above a given cutoff-scale with time-filtered fields. Varying the filter widths and times yields a precise picture of the various interactions. In a second step, we generalize the analysis to the Lagrangian frame to study the impact of large- and small-scale fluctuations on turbulent particle transport.",

We have implemented the multi-state Harten-Lax-van Leer approximate Riemann solver for ideal magnetohydrodynamics - HLLD (\"D\" denotes Discontinuities) in PIERNIK. Our goal is to perform numerical simulations of hypersonic astrophysical flows in 1, 2 and 3 spatial dimensions, particularly in the presence of discontinuities, using the HLLD Riemann solver. The HLLD Riemann solver is more robust than the linearized Riemann solver, capable of resolving isolated discontinuities formed in the MHD system (hence named as HLLD) and corresponds to the HLLC (\"C\" denotes Contact) Riemann solver when the magnetic field vanishes. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the HLLD Riemann solver implemented in PIERNIK through numerical tests and several interesting features available in the PIERNIK code.",

We propose an innovative approach based on complex networks theory, which combines elements from graph theory and statistical physics, providing a powerful framework to investigate complex systems.The network is built on a forced isotropic turbulent field, by evaluating the temporal correlation of the kinetic energy for pairs of nodes within the Taylor microscale, \\textit{$\\lambda$}. Among all the parameters analyzed, the degree centrality, \\textit{k}, is one of the most meaningful, representing how a node is linked to the others. We observe 3D patterns of high \\textit{k} values, which can be interpreted as regions of spatial coherence. The turbulent network exhibits typical behaviors of real and spatial networks (scale-free property). Similarly to other physical systems where complex networks successfully apply, our approach can give new insights for the spatial characterization of turbulence.",

The fluid interface is captured using a level set method implemented with either high-order WENO5 schemes or particles. Working on vorticity should allow to reduce the size of the domain by restricting it to the regions neighbouring walls and fluid interfaces. On the other hand, discretising on particles instead of a grid waives the CFL stability constraint and hence may allow higher time step values. Those potential benefits of vorticity over velocity and particles over grid are put to the test by comparing the performance of solvers on relevant benchmarks such as the dam break and rising bubble benchmarks.\n\nFinancial support from BelV is gratefully acknowledged.",

Additionally, a Boundary Layer Imaging (BLI) method by Kr\\\"{a}uter et al. (2014) images the thickness of a controllable fraction of the mass boundary layer with a horizontal resolution of 0.156 mm. Thus, the influence of Langmuir circulations and micro-scale breaking on the air-water gas transfer can be investigated. Besides these two imaging techniques, a thermographic setup determines the heat transfer at the water surface.

Typically the experiments areperformed by the light source, background pattern and the camera positioned on the opposite sides of a transparent vessel. The multi-media imaging through air-glass-water-glass-air leads to an additional aberration that destroys the reconstruction.

We propose to add to the smooth resolved velocity, an unresolved component, Gaussian, uncorrelated in time and inhomogeneous in space. This model changes the usual form of the material derivative of a tracer. This new form involves directly a multiplicative noise, an anisotropic and inhomogeneous diffusion, and a drift correction. As such, the rigorous derivation of this conservative model relates naturally the random forcing to the subgrid parametrization. Stochastic versions of classical models can then be derived from conservation of mass, energy and momentum. Numerical simulations of our stochastic version of Surface Quasi-Geostrophic model improves both the accuracy of a single simulation, as illustrated in Figure 1, and the ensemblepredective skills.",

The possible presence of a thermocline creates an inactive bottom layer that does not move causing all the discharge to be carried by the low depth strata. This study compares the results of dynamics simulations performed for the whole reservoir to the ones carried out for\\\\the upper strata only. The validity of the whole water body flow approximation is then discussed.",

This paper provides the part of research on aerodynamic influence of the rotating wheels on the car body. In order to investigate the contribution of wheels to overall vehicle drag, a simplified model of a car was tested in a wind tunnel PIV-based experiment in Magny-Cours (France) by PSA Peugeot Citroen. In parallel, CFD simulations campaign (using ANSYS CFX software) was conducted to enable formulation of wider conclusions on tyre shape influence on vehicle drag. The main aim was to establish a method of wheel-ground contact and relative motion modelling, allowing to estimate the aerodynamic role of wheels in vehicle air resistance via numerical simulations.",

It was recently suggested that the sign of turbophoresis can be actually opposite, so that particles agitated by turbulent fluid fluctuations go away from minima of fluctuations intensity if they are inertial enough. That means localization-delocalization transition upon the change of inertia: particles with small inertia go to a minimum of turbulence, while sufficiently inertial particles escape to infinity. We consider the motion of inertial particles near a wall in the case of inelastic particle-wall collisions. The phase diagram for the transition in the inertia-elasticity plane is found. If the restitution coefficient of particle velocity is smaller than some critical value, then the inelastic collapse occurs: the particles are localized near the wall for any inertia. The theoretical predictions are in a good agreement with the results of direct numerical simulations.",

This model couples the heart via a 0-D model of the aortic valve; in turn, such a valve is modeled by an ODE describing the force balance on its leaflets. Bigger arteries are considered 1-D, their bifurcations are solved by imposing flow and total pressure and their distal part is modeled by a Windkessel model.The aneurysm was then modeled by both modifying the geometrical properties of ascending aorta and varying their arterial stiffness. The resulting waveforms were analyzed using the backward-forward wave decomposition tool.",

For instance, it is often desired to enforce a uniform distribution of the temperature or a chemical reactant in the domain using minimal amount of work during a prescribed time.\n\nTo solve the optimal control problem the Lattice Bolztmann method is used. The method is is characterized by an inherited time dependence, easy implementation and almost ideal scalability on parallel supercomputers.\n\nThe author presents a discrete adjoint formulation to calculate sensitivity of the LBM solution. The derivatives are calculated from the code of the standard LBM solver using the AutomaticDifferentiation. The adjoint problem has similar properties to the primal one. These includes locality and explicit time-stepping, thus it can be straightforwardly incorporated to the original solver. This approach allows to solve the optimal control problem keeping the key scheme of LBM solver intact.",

Interaction of solid particles is studied within the granular flow model, when local constitutive equation can be used. In this model we derive 2D equilibrium flow with Keplerian velocity profile and radially stratified pressure, density and kinematic viscosity. \n\nWe use local shearing sheet model and neglect flow curvature to study the linear dynamics of vortex and spiral-density waves under the influence of granular rheology. We derive linear spectrum of the problem and show dissipative properties of individual wave modes. Using isentropic flow model we reduce to barotropic configuration where potential vorticity is conserved apart from viscous dissipation. In this limit we show potential vorticity generation mechanism due to the interplay of differential rotation and rheological properties of the flow. ",

The resulting dynamic blade loads are expected to be a limiting factor on the turbine performance and operational limits, but unsteady performance data for thicker aerofoil sections is not readily available and the blade design process only considers steady flows. The potential for blade surface biofouling complicates this issue further, particularly due to likely performance degradation during the device lifecycle.\n\nStatic and oscillatory wind tunnel tests have been conducted, including both clean and roughened blade sections to quantify the change in dynamic performance as a result of lifecycle fouling. Findings from this investigation will be presented highlighting the underlying fluid mechanisms and behaviour, dynamic flow modelling approaches, and their impact on tidal turbine design and performance.",

This approach is sometimes called field-scale approach. Current finer scale applications and field campaigns consider the heterogeneity of the canopies at the plant-scale (Schr\\\"{o}ttle and D\\\"{o}rnbrack 2013). We present results from plant-scale simulations of flow through resolved tree structures originating from laser scans. Simulating the wake of one wind turbine, e.g., above a forest requires a new computational approach. For this purpose, EULAG (Prusa et al. 2008) is modified to accommodate two independent hydrodynamic solvers. The two solvers are integrated simultaneously. The turbulence structure above a forest is simulated in the first solver at the field scale and acts as inflow for the wind turbine wake flow.",

Therefore an understanding of them is useful for weather forecasting. Typically in weather forecasting these downdrafts are modelled using the theory of a plume from Morton, Taylor and Turner (1956), which inherently assumes that the plume is long and thin. Downdrafts, are generally wider than they are high, and hence deviate from the Morton, Taylor and Turner theory. We perform experiments using finite releases of dense fluid from large area sources, releasing the fluid at a range of heights above the ground, which encompasses the typical geometries of downdrafts. By tracking the edges of the release and using PIV measurements we compare the dynamics of our experimental downdrafts to that of a classic Morton, Taylor and Turner plume. In so doing we are able to better inform the forecasting of weather arising from such downdrafts.",

Many practical applications and developing devices assume impinging jets to be spreading in narrow gaps with controlled wall roughness or with special designed micro-pattern surfaces.\n\nThis work presents a CFD investigation using the Fluent code of the evolution of a circular air jet impinging on a solid surface with one-direction square grooves (5 mm in width and depth). The Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations are performed in a 3D domain with symmetry boundary conditions. The jet Reynolds numbers used for the simulations are in the interval from 100 to 10000.The detailed distribution of velocity and pressure at the impingement of the air jet on the impacted plate are inferred. Finally, a comparison between the numerical results, a set of experiments performed in the laboratory and some relevant cases from literature is made and conclusions are drawn.",

This is done through the use of laboratory scale experiments on brittle heavily cross-linked hydrogels. These hydrogels have been shown to fracture similarly to `standard' brittle materials, which have been widely used to model geological mechanics. Crucially, the hydrogels are transparent, and permit fracturing at lower pressures and slower timescales. In particular, we will discuss fracturing regimes in which either viscous energy dissipation or material toughness dominates the rate of crack growth. Scaling laws for these regimes will be presented and matched against our experimental results.",

The models are placed in a middle of the flume with a uniform flow and a very low turbulence level separately for two cases. The rotor is three-bladed and designed using Glauerts optimum theory at a tip speed ratio \\textit{$\\lambda$} =5. The wake development has been studied in the wide range of \\textit{$\\lambda$}, \\textit{L} (a length between bodies) and at different cross-sections from 10\\textit{D} to 40\\textit{D} downstream from the first body. In order to fit velocity profiles regression techniques were used therefore it was possible to obtain accurate velocity deficits of the wake attenuation. The data are compared with analytical model (Johansson et al, 2003) for wind turbine and disk wakes.",

The Euler-Euler approach was applied to treat the 2-phase system in 3-dimensional domain. In order to properly predict the interactions between phases the physical model of a gravity driven liquid film, flowing countercurrently to the gas phase, was adopted according to Billet (1995). \\\\The model was developed in Ansys Fluent environment and the phase interactions as well as packed bed characteristics were implemented with the use of a user-defined function, a subroutine linked to the code.\\\\Test calculations have shown a very good agreement with the experimental trials.

Whilst the Morton, Taylor \\& Turner (1956) plume model is able to estimate the mean physical flux parameters, the process of entrainment is only parametrised in a time-averaged sense. Indeed, a deep understanding of turbulent entrainment is not widespread. We perform simultaneous PIV and plume-edge detection on a saline plume in water. We identify that significant mass is transported in regions of relatively high-momentum fluid between the large scale edges. This suggests that the large scale processes, whereby ambient fluid is engulfed into the plume, contribute significantly to the entrainment. This is in contrast to recent studies which have identified small scale nibbling as the dominant process. It may therefore be illuminating to consider entrainment as a series of distinct but interlinked processes occurring at multiple scales with each imparting a characterisation of plume fluid to the ambient.",

The role of twisted orifices is to intensify the mixing of large and small turbulent scales which potentially will lead to better mixing characteristics downstream of the pipe exit. The research is performed using the Large Eddy Simulation approach combined with an Immersed Boundary method to enable the analysis of objects with high spatial complexity.

There are some operating conditions close to upper part load under which aperiodical pulsations are also observed apart from synchronous pressure pulsation induced by precessing vortex rope. In such regimes vortex rope losses its stability. Parts of helix close in to each other and reconnection appears with formation of a vortex ring. We suppose that the formation of a vortex ring may cause aperiodic pressure pulsations inside the turbine draft tubes.

They achieve high internal fluid velocities due to a spinning flywheel with its axis of revolutions normal to the flow. After hitting the flywheel, the ore is shed upward into a filter, where particles small enough are passed further on towards the next process stage. Particles considered too big are recirculated back onto the flywheel. In this work a trajectory study of copper ore particles through a fan mill was performed with the use of a commercial CFD code, ANSYS Fluent, coupled two-way with DEM (Discrete Element Method). Particles of different sizes were analysed. Results highlight ore behaviour, fluid flow conditions and mark places requiring geometrical improvements.",

For the purposes various separation criteria were discussed.\\\\The experiment was carried out in low speed wind tunnel for three different adverse pressure gradients. The adverse pressure gradient is controlled by curvature of the upper wall and by flow suction at the same location. In the experiment hotwire anemometry technique was applied.",

The present work aims to extend knowledge on physics of auto-ignition problem and identify the influence of the turbulent flow conditions and numerical methods on the occurrence of auto-ignition, ignition time, localisation of flame kernel and its propagation. The Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES) approaches are used to study the auto-ignition in a temporally evolving mixing layer between two separate streams, cold fuel (hydrogen, methane)/hot air, moving in opposite directions or being stagnant. The analysis is performed for a wide range of the initial conditions (e.g. initial turbulent scales, size of the shear layer) and numerical methods.",

Using flow visualizations we characterize subcritical transition to turbulence and we show the existence of turbulent spots in plane Couette-Poiseuille flow. Due to zero mean advection velocity of the base profile, these turbulent structures are nearly stationary (despite a non-zero pressure gradient in streamwise direction). We ascertain two characteristic wavenumbers correspond to two different inner regions of the base flow.

However, Nu values obtained for Bingham fluids are smaller than that obtained in the case of Newtonian fluids with the same nominal value of Richardson number (Ri) due to weakening of convective transport.

The new FSI model was used to study basilar membrane deflections and pressure distribution in the cochlea at three excitation frequencies: 2.5, 5 and 10kHz. The model was validated against experimental data. The model gives interesting information which can be helpful in the inner ear mechanics study.The cochlea physiology can be well simulated by our new FSI model. Differential perilymph pressures, derived from the FSI model may be used to analyse the effectiveness of cochlear stimulation by various hearing reconstruction methods.",

The test case consists of pipe with 50 mm in diameter and 100d in length, with solid body rotation on the inlet boundary. Downstream the inlet, there is a contraction ring which generates global flow instability and reduces development length of the fluid flow.\n\nOur research has revealed strong influence of spatial discretization on flow field variables, especially in the wake of the contraction ring, where boundary layer becomes detached. Multiple grids with different topologies have been analysed and results provide guidance for grid construction. Additionally, (U)RANS models have been shown seriously lacking in thedescription of swirling flows.",

The contemporary Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers advanced numerical tools, which can accompany the experimental analysis. The present work concerns the numerical analysis of an externally excited round jet at various initial conditions and draws particular attention on the impact of the numerical approach on the formation of the side jets, their number and localisation. The side jets are very sensitive to external disturbances, even those originating from discretisation. From the point of view of data validation, the potential influence of the numerical approach on the physics of the flow has to be known and any artificial impact should be excluded. The research is performed applying Large Eddy Simulation method and high-order codes based on Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems.",

Described in 1956 as an oceanographic curiosity, salt fingers are now recognized as an important mechanism for vertical transport in fluids and have been reported in contexts as diverse as geophysics, astrophysics, oceanography, material sciences and engineering. \\\\ Salt finger systems are frequently modelled assuming constant linear vertical backgrounds of T and S, which leads to a steady or quasi-steady transport with a constant flux ratio of the agents. However, relaxing the constraints on the vertical backgrounds leads to time dependent regimes with complex patterns of vertical transport, conditioned mainly by the efficiency of the systems as releasers of potential energy and by the degree of imbalance in the vertical transport of the agents.

New concept of interstage cooling system uses liquid to transfer heat from one place to another. Heat transfer medium could be water or carbon dioxide at high pressure. Compressor stators are used as the heat exchange elements. The main problem is limited area of heat exchange between stator blades and air and not sufficient heat transfer intensity outside of the boundary thermal layer. Intensification of heat transfer process could be realized by compressor stators geometry modifications. Numerical simulation of flow in compressor cascade was performed. Analysis shows that proposed stator geometry changes provide better mixing of fluid at different temperatures and more uniform temperature distribution downstream stators.",

Main idea behind it, is to interpolate fields within the range of the so-called smoothing length for discrete particles representing continuous medium. Governing equations are then solved by calculating interactions between them. There is no universal SPH formulation for fluid-flow computations. Depending on purpose and assumptions, different forms of governing equations in SPH language can be obtained. Because of this the method itself is still object of intense research and development.\n\nIn the present study we apply SPH to simulate flow of incompressible, viscous fluid around obstacles. Our main goal is to determine which SPH formulation, kernel interpolation function and boundary conditions implementation yields most accurate predictions. For that purpose a number of simulations have been performed and their results compared.",

Depending on the initial reactants concentration, two reaction modes are observed. The first one is a diffusion mode, where the predominant mass transfer mechanism is diffusion, leading to slow rates of reaction and the second one is convective regime characterizing by the formation of the intense convective motion and rapid reaction. Moreover a new type of instability was found (Fig.1).

However, as shown by this study, adding an amount of swirl significantly enhances mixing in an annular jet flow with Re=180. Applications that need turbulent-like flow features such as mixing, or centrifugal forces that usually are associated with higher Reynolds numbers, are being modeled in a laminar regime. The flow features arising from this flow state are simulated with a 3D grid using the direct numerical simulation approach with a proper grid independence study. Velocity fields and turbulence parameters are presented. The velocity field is also measured with Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) experiments. The results of the simulation and the experiments are compared and assessed in terms of first and second order statistics. ",

Since the rigorous analysis or simulation of fluid flow over the scales of interest is beyond our capabilities, we turn to a class of dynamical systems called shell models that have been shown to model turbulent flow qualitatively. We focus on one such model of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The analysis is based on a renormalization scheme which takes blowup time to infinity. This transformation associates the blowup to an attractor of the renormalized system, found from its Poincare map. This way, we describe the blowup structure and explain its universality. This approach shows that, for some parameters, the blowup has a chaotic structure. Moreover, we observe an interesting effect of coexisting blowup scenarios in a specific model, which are selected based on the initial conditions. Implications of these results for MHD are discussed.",

We will present implicit single-phase flow solver with k-OmegaSST turublence model that is x2-x3 faster than the same solver running on 12-core CPU. In contrary to other solutions a SIMPLE and the PISO algorithms have been completely implemented on a graphics processing unit in CUDA and OpenCL. \n\nExtensive tests were performed to compare solution times for a group of CFD relevant cases on new Intel processors, new IBM Power8 processors and NVIDIA GPUs.

Inertial-range asymptotic behavior of a vector (e.g., magnetic) field, passively advected by a strongly anisotropic turbulent flow, is investigated by means of the field theoretic renormalization group and the operator product expansion. The inertial-range behavior of the model is described by two regimes (the limits of vanishing or infinite correlation time) that correspond to non-trivial fixed points of the RG equations. In contrast to the well-known isotropic Kraichnan's model, where various correlation functions exhibit anomalous scaling behavior with infinite sets of anomalous exponents, here the dependence on the integral turbulence scale L has a logarithmic behavior. Due to the presence of anisotropy in the model all multiloop diagrams are equal to zero, thus, this result is exact.",

In some areas, like pollutant dispersion atmospheric stability is crucial.\n\nOur work was focused on examining the stratified flow around a tall building, taking into account different stabilities with idealized flow conditions. The LES model EULAG was used to simulate the flow around The Palace of Culture and Science as an example of complex shape structure. Simulations were performed with different stabilities and Froude numbers.\n\nResults show, that for Fr < 1 in addition to horseshoe and recirculation vortex know from literature, secondary, previously unreported vortices appear. These vortices seem to be strongly related the developing standing gravity waves. With decreasing Froude number, gravity waves become shorter and more of those new vortices appear. Similar flow structures were observed for idealized building shape.",

In this work co-simulation approach to simulate rigid body dynamics in presence of unsteady aerodynamics forces is presented. Software ecosystem is constructed from the following combination of tools: Fluent as a CFD solver, MSC.Adams as a rigid body dynamics solver and Matlab/Simulink as an interface and controller. Having system like this one to simulate FSI problems, it was possible to add elements of active control, utilizing unsteady generation of aerodynamic forces.

On the other hand, results from averaged modelling of the process are most common in the literature.

SC(2)-0714 may be considered as a model airfoil in its class because of wide range of available experimental data. However, it was examined mainly in low temperature wind tunnels, which operating range is restricted solely to dry air because of construction limitations. The results obtained in a IAAM indraft transonic wind tunnel expand the existing knowledge in the field of supercritical airfoil properties.

The criterion has been deduced based on a posteriori assessment of local field interpolation error for turbulent kinetic energy. \n\nThe proposed criterion was tested on the several cases. In this paper, the proposed criterion was applied to unsteady periodicdetached turbulent flow over semicircle profile at zero angle of attack at Reynolds number Re=50000 (Fig. 1). Two eddyviscosityRANS models k-$\\omega$ SST with curvature correction and model with elliptical relaxation k-e-$\\zeta$-f were used for modeling.\n\n Numerical study shown that mesh resolution in wake does not affect on flow near body, in particularly, on integral forces acting on streamlined body. It was shown that introduced criterion allows properly to assess mesh resolution requiredfor grid-independent solution away from the wall.",

The modeled valve prosthesis used in the simulation is a St. Jude Medical valves with three sinuses Valsava grafts. The results include essential fluid flow parameters such as instant velocity contours, pressure distribution, turbulent shear stresses along the aortic valve and also angles of the leaflets during complete cycles which are meaningful data to evaluate the blood flow and behavior of the bileaflet under changes in cardiac cycle length within a wide range. From obtained turbulent shear stresses in systolic phase, the mechanical hemolysis of the red blood cells is then studied. Results describe that changes in cycle length strongly affect stability of leaflet dynamics after a large number of cardiac cycles (\\textasciitilde{}30 cycles).",

These are ice clouds that very frequently occur in the tropopause region with an optical depth lower than 0.03 and a very low ice crystal number concentration.

However, due to the large spatial scale range and enormous Reynolds number involved, existing field experiments can hardly resolve the small scale (e.g. komogorov length scale) properties in cloud turbulence. In this experiment, we use a modified Rayleigh Bernard convection cell to study the dynamics of water droplets in the thermal driven turbulent background. The water droplets are formed by isobaric mixing of cold and hot moist air at the top and bottom plate respectively. The system involves into a steady state and enables us to do particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) and particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) analysis. We also use a fast camera in combination with a stereo microscope to visualize individual water droplets. The size distribution of water droplets is found in agreement with that found in a cumulus clouds.",

The length varies from 50cm to 200cm in order to cover a wide Rayleigh number (Ra) range from 1x10\\textsuperscript{9}to 1x10\\textsuperscript{12}. The non-dimensional heat flux Nusselt number (Nu) scales with Ra with the exponent equal to 0.3, which differs from the known 0.2 scaling. The temperature profile measurements along the vertical direction at different horizontal locations show that there is a strongly stratified thermal boundary layer (BL) and a weakly stratified interior. The BL thickness follows a -0.3 power law. At last, we studied the bottom heating effects in some other small tanks. The results show that the effects of bottom heating flux on Nu is negligible, although the flow dynamics in the interior change significantly.",

        "content": "In 2004 and 2007 the two Voyagers crossed the termination shock entering the heliosheath, where the solar wind is slowed down and interacts with the interstellar medium. Many observations are not fully understood, one of these is the difference in the profiles of energetic ions and electrons fluxes recorded by V1 and V2. The high fluctuations of particles fluxes at V2 led researchers suppose the existence of two regions with distinct magnetic field features inside the HS: the sectored heliosheath, at low latitudes, and the unipolar heliosheath. These regions should have different transport properties, and the presence of turbulence may play a key role. In this work we analyze the spectral behaviour of magnetic field from V1 and V2 data in both the SHS and the UHS after 2009. The power spectra at V1 show a higher anisotropy level and slope than V2 in the intermediate range. A spectral bumb at f = 5e4 Hz is observed before 2010.5 and awaits a consistent physical interpretation.",

The structure of laboratory cyclonic vortex is similar to the typical structure of tropical cyclones from observational data and numerical modelling. Different constraints of the steady-state hurricane-like vortex were studied. The three main dimensional parameters that define the vortex structure-heating flux, rotation rate and viscosity were varied independently.It was shown that viscosity is one of the main parameters that define vortex structure. Increasing of kinematic viscosity value may lead to the total suppression of cyclonic motion.",

The model proposed is based on depth-integrated RANS equations. Turbulent characteristics of the flow were computed from the depth averaged high-Reynolds modification of the k-epsilon turbulence model. The model also includes wind stresses on water surface, bottom share stresses depending on roughness, and terms to account for the Coriolis force that are significant for the flow in a river.A finite volume method on the staggered structured grid was used to discretize the equations. Solution of the discrete system was obtained with a SIMPLE iterative algorithm. The results of the calculations for test cases for the problems described show agreement with general concepts and represent flow patterns observed in field studies of the river.",

The results of the PIV measurements was analysed in order to investigate the development of flow separation for low, medium and high angle of attack. Good agreement with theoretical models reported in the literature was observed. Two types of velocity profiles in the wake was distinguished. The results of the presented research can be used for better understanding of the mechanism of the flow separation process in transonic flow over airfoils and shock induced flow separation.",
