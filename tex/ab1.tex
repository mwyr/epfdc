The water droplet detachment from solid surfaces is a phenomenon observed in various fields of engineering, and is of importance in those mainly involving draining or drying. This analytical work describes the analysis and development of a criterion for water droplet expulsion from horizontal solid surfaces by means of calculating the resultant shear stress caused by the airflow. The proposed model is expected to contribute to the knowledge of water removal, mainly in drying systems. The model presented here may be applied in different applications such as car washing machines, hair dryers and/or drainage systems.
