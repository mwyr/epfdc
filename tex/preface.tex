\section*{Preface}

The European Postgraduate Fluid Dynamics Conference (EPFDC) has been organized since 2007 and held initially every year and recently every other year with usually around 80 participants. The conference is organized and designed for PhD students. It is aimed in giving them opportunity to present and discuss their research in an international and young community, broadening their horizons and networking with other students from a wide area of fluid dynamics.

The conference includes inspiring plenary lectures by experienced and successful academics with varied research interests. They share both experience and perspectives within their research interests.

The conference also provides a friendly environment in which those new to speaking at conferences may present their work, and previous conferences have shown a very high standard of presented material. All participants are expected to give a short talk or bring a poster. Poster sessions and social events provide the opportunity for more informal feedback and a chance to network with other students as well as with plenary speakers.
